## Project Overview

Documentation [wiki](https://docs.sirenai.org)
Documentation repository [github](https://github.com/yunzaixi-dev/sirenai-docs)

SirenAI is an open-source fork of [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern), licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license. This project was established to better serve the Chinese AI Character Card Open Source Communities.

## Project Vision

We plan to perform a 100% reconstruction of SillyTavern using the Flutter framework, migrating the tavern's cloud logic to the client-side to achieve:

- 🚀 Significantly improved performance
- 💫 Greatly enhanced user experience
- 🔒 Substantially increased security
- 🔄 Maximum compatibility where possible
